# Bank-Loan-Analysis
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

This project focuses on analyzing a bankâ€™s loan portfolio to assess lending performance, borrower profiles, and overall portfolio health. The analysis provides both high-level KPIs and deep-dive segmentations, enabling better decision-making for credit risk management.

Project Overview
Performed comprehensive loan data analysis to monitor key metrics such as loan applications, funded amounts, repayment volumes, and borrower demographics.

Developed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Total Applications, Total Funded Amount, Repayment Totals, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) to track portfolio performance and borrower financial health.

Conducted credit risk segmentation by categorizing loans into Good and Bad classes based on repayment status and default risk, enabling a clearer view of portfolio quality.

Created interactive and visual dashboards to display monthly trends, regional loan distributions, and loan term patterns, providing actionable insights for operations and strategic planning.

Key Insights & Outcomes
Identified trends in loan approvals, funding patterns, and repayment behavior to inform lending strategy.

Highlighted high-risk borrower profiles using DTI and repayment patterns for better risk mitigation.

Provided management with a data-backed approach to optimize loan products and improve recovery strategies.
